<h4>Protecting Vulnerable Fish and the Legacy of Fishermen</h4>
          <p>Ocean Conservancy has worked for more than 20 years to support sustainable U.S. fisheries. It’s in everyone’s best interest—distributors, retailers, fishermen and consumers—to restore the ocean’s bounty and strengthen our coastal economies. Here at Ocean Conservancy, we’re working closely with stakeholders to develop sustainable fishing plans that will preserve the industry, and the ecosystem, for generations to come. Check out some of our priorities below.</p>

            <p><strong>Leading the world in fisheries management.</strong></p>

<p>Over the past four decades, we’ve made real progress toward ending overfishing in U.S. waters and rebuilding fish populations. And we have a little-known law with a long name to thank: the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).</p>
          <p><img src="https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MSA-infographic-healthy-ecosystem.png" width="800" height="600" alt="Infographic"></p>
           <p>Since 2007, the percentage of fish populations that are facing overfishing, or that are already overfished, has decreased—even as catches are increasing. In 2015 alone, red snapper quotas were raised by more than 20 percent because the population is rebuilding, thanks to science-based management, better incentives for conservation and accountability for performance.</p>
            <p>This points to positive recovery for our nation’s fisheries. It’s clear that sound science and long term management is working for America’s fish stocks as well as our economy.</p>
            <p>Here at Ocean Conservancy, we’re committed to defending the integrity of the MSA so we can have healthy fish populations for generations to come.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Considering the bigger picture</strong></p>
            <p>Sustainable fisheries require more than just counting the number of fish in the sea. We also need to look at the environment they live in. By incorporating factors like fishes’ habitat and number of prey fish available, we can better understand how many fish we can sustainably take out of the ocean. This is called ecosystem-based fisheries management. If used correctly, ecosystem-based management can result in healthier and more resilient fisheries because we consider multiple species at the same time. It’s a great way to work smarter, not harder, when it comes to fisheries management!</p>
            <p><strong>To keep up with changing ocean conditions, we must always be looking ahead.</strong></p>
            <p>Ocean Conservancy is on the forefront of emerging fisheries solutions to keep pace with the unprecedented changes that are occurring in our oceans. Fisheries management has long since been approached by monitoring catches and the abundance of fish populations. With the revolution in information and computing power, we’re able to apply sophisticated tools that help provide a much clearer view of how the fishermen’s responses to things like ocean conditions and market forces impact the sustainability of fish populations. Our modeling project aims to identify simpler, more nimble and the most effective approaches to fisheries management, and bring together multiple international organizations, all working to create sustainably managed fisheries worldwide.</p>
