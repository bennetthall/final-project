            <h1>Blacktip Reef Shark</h1>
            <h4>CARCHARHINUS MELANOPTERUS</h4>
          <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>Bet you can’t guess where you’re likely to find me? Coral reefs, that’s right! Just like other reef sharks, the coral reef is my favorite place to hang out. I like to swim in shallow waters, usually with my dorsal fins above the surface showing off my black tips. So, now you can see how I got my name—clever, right?

My thick skin is covered in a sheath of tooth-like scales called denticles. These help me swim quickly through the water and protect me from pesky parasites! We are viviparous sharks—producing live pups instead of eggs—and give birth up to four pups each year. The pups reach maturity around four years old for males and seven years old for females.

While most sharks are solo hunters, we believe in team work! You’ll find us hanging out together and relying on one another to catch prey in packs. When we find a school of fish, we will circle our prey into a tight ball before going in for the kill. Some researchers have found that we may actually be social creatures with close friends!

My home in the coral reefs is being damaged by ocean acidification—which occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon and becomes acidified. I love living among thriving reefs, but increasing acidification degrades the physical structure of these reefs, putting my habitat and food supply at risk. This affects all the creatures living among the reef—not just my team of fellow blacktip reef sharks.</p>
          <h1>Clownfish</h1>
            <h4>AMPHIPRIONINAE</h4>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>You probably know me for my colorful appearance. I can take on different colors, but the best known species of clownfish (of more than 30 species) is orange with white stripes.

I live in a symbiotic relationship with my host anemone. This means that while I get to enjoy the protection and the food scraps my anemone provides, I fend off intruders and help keep it clean by removing parasites and dead limbs. It’s a win-win situation for both me and my anemone!

I’m very picky about my home. It has to be just right for me to want to live there. Only about ten out of over one thousand species of anemone are suitable hosts for me. The mucus layer on my skin gives me immunity to the anemone’s stinging nematocysts. But before I can get settled in to living with an anemone, I first have to become acclimated to its sting by gently touching its tentacles. Lucky for me, other fish do not have the same protective mucus layer I do, so my host anemone is my partner in crime when it comes to scaring away predators!</p>
            <h1>Coral</h1>
            <h4>HEXACORALLIA</h4>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>You may recognize us from the colorful reefs we form in tropical waters around the world, but did you know we are actually made of tiny organisms called polyps? Our polyps are soft-bodied, but secrete limestone skeletons for support. Our iconic reefs are formed when many, many polyps come together and build on one another. The result is a colony of polyps that actually act as one organism!

We get our colorful hues from algae called zooxanthellae (polyps are actually see-through!). Polyps and zooxanthellae have a symbiotic relationship, where we get food from the algae in exchange for housing and protection in our hard structure. When we get stressed out by things like pollution or high temperatures, we kick the zooxanthellae out. This is called coral bleaching, and can actually kill us if it goes on for too long!
